# Clustring Algorithmes From Scratch

This repository contains **from-scratch implementations of clustering algorithms** in Python, built for learning, experimentation, and comparison.  
All algorithms are implemented without relying on high-level machine learning libraries, enabling a deeper understanding of fundamental mechanics, objective functions, cluster behavior, and limitations.

Clustering is a core unsupervised learning technique used in:
- exploratory data analysis
- segmentation and pattern discovery
- anomaly detection
- image / spatial grouping
- high-dimensional data summarization

## 📌 Algorithms Implemented

### 🔹 **K-Means**
Partition points into K clusters using iterative centroid updates.

### 🔹 **DBSCAN**
Density-based clustering that identifies clusters and noise.

### 🔹 **Hierarchical Clustering**
Agglomerative (bottom-up) clustering based on linkage criteria.

### 🔹 **Mean Shift**
Cluster detection via mode seeking in feature space.

Each implementation is built **from scratch** — no calls to scikit-learn clustering functions — to solidify algorithmic intuition.
